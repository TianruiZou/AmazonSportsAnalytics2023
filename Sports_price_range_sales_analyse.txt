Key Findings:
Low-priced products (£0–50) dominate the market, accounting for over 95% of total sales.

Mid-priced products (£50–200) contribute about 4.6% of total sales.

High-priced products (over £200) account for only around 0.5% of sales.

Implications:
This analysis shows that:

The primary consumer base for sports & outdoor products tends to prefer low-priced items.

Sales drop significantly once the price exceeds £50.

Products priced above £200 have very limited sales.

These insights are highly useful for pricing strategy and product positioning.

Recommendations:
Focus on developing products priced below £50, as this is the strongest performing price segment.

Be especially cautious with high-priced products (over £200) — success in this range requires precise market targeting.

Consider expanding the product range within the £50–100 bracket, as it performs relatively well among mid- to low-priced products.
