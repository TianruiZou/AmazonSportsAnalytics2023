Key Findings:
Total Sales:
The £0–50 price range dominates the market, contributing over 95% of total sales.

The £50–100 range ranks second, but sales are significantly lower than the low-price segment.

Sales drop sharply for products priced over £100.

Product Count:
The £0–50 range also contains the largest number of products, accounting for over 75% of all listings.

The £50–100 range ranks second in product count.

As price increases, product count decreases.

Average Sales:
Products in the £0–50 range have the highest average sales at 1.37 units per item.

All other price ranges have an average sales rate below 0.35 units/item.

Products priced above £300 show a notably low average sales rate.

Recommendations:
Focus on product development within the £0–50 range, as it is the most profitable and best-selling price segment.

For products in the £50–100 range, although the average sales are low, the product count is high — so consider optimizing product quality, price, or visibility to improve performance.

For high-priced products (£200+), exercise caution — success in this segment likely depends on precise market targeting and refined marketing strategies.
