Data Distribution:
High-sales products (≥1000/month): 106 items

Normal-sales products (<1000/month): 154,371 items

High-sales products account for only ~0.07% of the total

Correlation Analysis:
High-sales products:
Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.0885 (p-value = 0.3668)

Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.0778 (p-value = 0.4280)

No significant correlation (p-value > 0.05)

Normal-sales products:
Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.0165 (p-value < 0.0001)

Spearman correlation coefficient: -0.0107 (p-value < 0.0001)

While statistically significant, the correlation is extremely weak

Rating Distribution Characteristics:
High-sales products:
Ratings are concentrated between 3.5 and 5.0

Most products are rated between 4.3 and 4.6

Almost no products are rated below 3.5

Normal-sales products:
Much broader distribution, ranging from 1.0 to 5.0

Distribution is right-skewed, with most ratings between 4.0 and 4.7

A very large number of products have a perfect rating of 5.0 (27,360 items)

Implications:
High-sales products generally have higher ratings (mostly above 3.5)

However, there is no strong linear correlation between rating and sales

Ratings of high-sales products are more tightly concentrated in the high range

For products with monthly sales under 1000, the correlation analysis shows:

Correlation Results (Normal-Sales Products):
Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.0165

Indicates an extremely weak positive correlation between rating and sales

Spearman correlation coefficient: -0.0107

Indicates an extremely weak negative correlation between rating and sales

Both p-values are very small (< 0.0001), meaning these weak correlations are statistically significant, but practically negligible

Generated Visualizations:

Shows scatter plot with regression line between rating and sales

stars_avg_sales.png:
Compares average sales by different rating levels

Key Insights:
The correlation between rating and sales is extremely weak, almost negligible

This suggests that customer purchasing decisions may not heavily depend on product ratings

Other factors — such as price, brand, product description, or marketing — might have a greater influence on sales
